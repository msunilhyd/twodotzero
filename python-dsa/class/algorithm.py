Examples of Algorithms In Programming

Write an algorithm to add two numbers entered by the user

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables num1, num2 and sum
Step 3: Read values num1 and num2
Step 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to the sum
        sum <- num1 + num2
Step 5: Display sum
Step 6: Stop

Write an algorithm to find the largest among three different
numbers entered by the user

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables a, b and c
Step 3: Read variables a, b and c
Step 4: If a > b
            If a > c
                Display a is the largest number
            Else
                Display c is the largest number
        Else
            If b > c
                Display b is the largest number
            Else
                Display c is the greatest number
Step 5: Stop
