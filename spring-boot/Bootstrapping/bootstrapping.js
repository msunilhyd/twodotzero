Spring Boot - Bootstrapping
This chapter will explain you how to perform bootstrapping on a Spring Boot
application

Spring Initializer
One of the ways to Bootstrapping a Spring Boot application is by using
Spring Initializer. To do this, you will have to visit the Spring Initializer
web page www.start.spring.io and choose your Build, Spring Boot Version and
platform. Also, you need to provide a Group, Artifact and required dependencies
to run the application.

Observe the following screenshot that shows an example where we added the
spring-boot-starter-web dependency to write REST Endpoints.

Once you provided the Group, Artifact, Dependencies, Build Project, Platform
and Version, click Generate Project button. The zip file will download and
the files will be extracted.

This section explains you the examples by using both Maven and Gradle.
Maven

After you download the project, unzip the file. Now, your pom.xml file looks
as shown below âˆ’


<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns = "http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
    xmlns:xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation = "http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0

Gradle
Once you download the project, unzip the file. Now your build.gradle file
looks as shown below-

buildScript {
  ext {
    springBootVersion = '1.5.8.RELEASE'
  }
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:${springBootVersion}")
  }
}

apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'eclipse'
apply plugin: 'org.springframework.boot'

group = 'com.tutorialspoint'
version = '0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'
souceCompatibility = 1.8

repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
  compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web')
  testCompile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test')
}

Class Path Dependencies
Spring Boot provides a number of starters to add the jars in our class path.
For example, for writing a Rest Endpoint, we need to add the
spring-boot-starter-web dependency in our class path. Observe the codes shown
below for a better understanding

Maven dependency
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>

Gradle dependency
dependencies {
  compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web')
}


Main method
The main method should be writing the Spring Boot Application class.
This class should be annotated with @SpringBootApplication. This is the entry
point of the spring boot application to start. You can find the main class file
under src/java/main directories with default package.

In this example, the main class file is located at the src/java/main directories
with the default package com.tutorialspoint.demo. Observe the code shown
here for a better understanding -

package com.tutorialspoint.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
  }
}

Write a Rest Endpoint
To write a simple Hello World Rest Endpoint in the Spring Boot Application
main class file itself, follow the steps shown below -
- Firstly. add the @RestController annotation at the top of the class
- Now, write a RequestURI method with @RequestMapping annotation
- Then, the Request URI method should return the Hello World string.

Now, your main Spring Boot Application class file will look like as shown in
the code given below -

package com.tutorialspoint.demo

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
@RestController

public class DemoApplication {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
  }
  @RequestMapping(value = "/")
  pubic String hello() {
    return "Hello World";
  }
}

Create and Executable JAR
Let us create and executable jar file to run the Spring Boot Application by
using  Maven and Gradle commands in the command prompt as shown below -

Use the Maven command mvn clean install as shown below -
C:\demo> mvn clean install

After executing the command, you can see the BUILD SUCCESS message at the
command prompt as shown below -

[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

Use the Gradle command gradle clean build as shown below -
C:\demo>gradle clean build

After executing the command, you can see the BUILD SUCCESSFUL message in the
command prompt as shown below -

BUILD SUCCESSFUL

Run Hello World with Java
Once you have created an executable JAR file, you can find it under the
following directories.
For Maven, you can find the JAR file under the target directory as shown below-

C:\demo\target
demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

For Grade, you can find the JAR file under the builds/libs directory as
shown below-

C:\demo\build\libs
demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original

Now run the JAR file by using the command java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.
Observe in the above example, the JAR file is named demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

C:\demo\target> java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Once you run the jar file, you can see the output in the console window
as shown below -

:Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http)
:Started DemoApplication in 6.092 seconds (JVM running for 8.119)

Now, look at the console, Tomcat started on port 8080 (http).
Now, go to the web browser and hit the URL http://localhost:8080/
and you can see the output as shown below -
