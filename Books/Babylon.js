Money is the medium by which earthly success is measured

Money makes possible the enjoyment of the best the earth affords

Money is plentiful for those who understand the simple laws
    which govern its acquisition

Money is governed today by the same laws which controlled it when
    prosperous men thronged the streets of Babylon, six thousand
    years ago
