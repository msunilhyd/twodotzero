What can a book written in the 1920 tell modern investors about their finances?
A whole lot if its George Clason's delightful set of parables that explain the
basics of money. This is a great gift for a graduate or anyone who seems baffled
by the world of finance and a wonderful, refreshing read for even the most
experienced investor. - Los Angeles Times

The Man Who Desired Gold

Bansir, the chariot builder of Babylon, was thoroughly discouraged. From his seat
upon the low wall surrounding his property, he gazed sadly at his simple home and
the open workshop in which stood a partially completed chariot.
  His wife frequently appeared at the open door. Her furtive glances in his direction
reminded him that the meal bag was almost empty and he should be at work finishing
the chariot, hammering and hewing, polishing and painting, stretching taut the
leather over the wheel rims, preparing it for delivery so he could collect from
his wealthy customer. Nevertheless, his fat, muscular body sat stolidly upon the
wall. His slow mind was struggling patiently with a problem for which he could
find no answer. The hot, trpical sun, so typical of this valley of the Euphrates,
beat down upon him mercilessly. Beads of perspiration formed upon his brow and
trickled down unnoticed to lose themselves in the hairy jungle on his chest.
  Beyond his home towered the high terraced walls surrounding the king's palace.
Nearby, cleaving the blue heavens, was the painted tower of the temple of Bel.
In the shadow of such grandeur was his simple home and many others far less neat
and well cared for. Babylon was like this - a mixture of grandeur and squalor, of
dazzling wealth and direst poverty crowded together without plan or system within
the protecting walls of the city.
  Behind him, had he cared to turn and look, the noisy chariots of the rich jostled
and crowded aside the sandaled tradesmen as well as the barefooted beggars. Even
the rich were forced to turn into the gutters to clear the way for the long lines
of slave water carriers, on the "king's business," each baring a heavy goatskin
of water to be poured upon the hanging gardens.
  Bansir was too engrossed in his own problem to hear or heed the confused hubub
of the busy city. It was the unexpected twanging of the strings from a familiar
lyre that aroused him from his reverie. He turned and looked into the sensitive,
smiling face of his best friend - Kobbie, the musician.
  "May the Gods bless thee with great liberality, my good friend," began Kobbie
with an elaborate salute. "Yet, it does appear they have already been so generous
thou needest not to labour. I rejoice with thee in thy good fortune. More, I would
even share it with thee. Pray, from thy purse which must be bugling else thou
wouldst be busy in yon shop , extract but two humble shekels and lend them to me
until after the nobleman's feast this night. Thou wilt not miss them ere they
are returned."
  "If I did have two shekels," Bansir responded gloomily, "to no one could I
lend them - not even to you, my best of friends; for they would be my fortune -
my entire fortune. No one lends his entire fortune, not even to his best friend."
  "What," exclaimed Kobbi with genuine surprise. "Thou hast not one shekel in thy
purse, yet sit like a statue upon a wall! Why not complete that chariot? How else
canst thou provide for thy noble apetite? 'Tis not like thee, my friend. Where is
they endless energy? Doth something distress thee? Have the Gods brought to these
troubles?'"
    "A torment from the Gods it must be," Bansir agreed. "It began with a dream
a senseless dream, in which I thought I was a man of means. From my belt hung a
handsome purse, heavy with coins. There were shekels which I cast with careless
freedom to the beggars; there were pieces of silver with which I did buy finery
for my wife and whatever I did desire for myself; there were pieces of gold which
made me feel assured of the future and unafraid to spend the silver. A glorious
feeling of contentment was within me! You would not have known me for thy hard
working friend. Now wouldst have known my wife, so free from wrinkles was her
face and shining with happiness. She was again the smiling maiden of our early
married days."
  "A pleasant dream, indeed," commented Kobbi, "but why should such pleasant
feelings as it aroused turn thee into a glum statue upon the wall?"
"Why, indeed! Because when I awoke and remembered how empty was my purse, a
feeling of rebellion swept over me. Let us talk it over together, for, as the
sailors do say, we ride in the same boat, we two. As youngsters, we went together
to the priests to learn wisdom. As young men, we shared each other's pleasures.
As grown men, we have always been close friends. We have been contended subjects
of our kind.  "
